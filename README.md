# stream-overlay

Stream Overlay is a customisable overlay designed to enhance live streams by allowing remote control of various elements from a computer or phone. With this overlay, users can easily manage and display scrolling messages in the bottom bar, display important text in a large box, and even use a dynamic 'ticker' feature to highlight new entrants with their name and subtitle. It also supports dynamic effects such as confetti and snowfall.

This real-time, interactive overlay takes control of the visual elements of the stream away from the person running the livestream in OBS and allows someone else to manage it efficiently. By enabling remote control, the stream operator can focus on delivering compelling content while letting someone else manage the overlay.

The Overlay proved its effectiveness during JuweStream, a monumental professional-level livestream by Juwenalia Krakoskie. Juwenalia Krakoskie is one of the largest music events of its type in Poland, and the stream itself was a world first in terms of scale and professionalism. The stream was entirely produced by student volunteers and this overlay played a key role in ensuring a smooth and visually stunning experience.

The overlay also made its debut during the AGH Święta Dzieciom charity livestream, where it was used to raise funds for a foundation dedicated to helping children in need. The livestream featured live calls into the studio, allowing viewers to ask questions and have their SMS messages displayed in real time on the bottom bar of the overlay.
